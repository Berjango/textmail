NO GUARANTEES,
USE AT OWN RISK

This program is not meant for the general public ,like all my programs,it is only useful for people who already do programming and can modify it
to suit themsleves and get it working properly in their situation.

Terminal based lightweight python program to print and process last few emails.May be useful for quickly checking last few emails and for cyber security purposes.

Does not do html or follow links so not good at viewing strongly html based emails.

Processing options include : deleting emails,skipping emails,banning email addresses,autodeleting oldest emails and saving emails.

Development status - Working ok,nearing completion.

To run, type the following in a terminal

python3 printlatestemails.py

print5emails.py and print15emails also may work but  are old versions and should not be used


Two other programs are included for the purpose of decreasing the size of the inbox.Both are dangerous programs and need to be used with extreme caution.It is best to back up your inbox before using -


python3 delete500emails.py -- deletes the oldest 500 emails.

python3 deletebannedmeails.py -- deletes all banned emails in the inbox.The "banned" file needs to exist for this to work.This is a text file named "banned" with parts of a banned email address on each consecutive lines.

KNOWN bugs - saving not working properly,partly works
